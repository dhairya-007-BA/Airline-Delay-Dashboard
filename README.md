Built an end-to-end data analytics solution to investigate airline and airport delay trends across the U.S., using Python and Excel for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization.

Data Preparation:
Used Python (Pandas) to clean, reshape, and merge raw DOT datasets.
Performed missing value treatment, aggregation, and calculated delay rates.
Validated data accuracy and normalized field names using Excel for cross-verification.

Key Visualizations:
1. Top 10 Most Delayed Airlines (Avg Delay Rate %):
Description: Bar chart showing airlines with the highest average delay rate.
Importance: Highlights underperforming carriers and potential targets for customer complaint management, regulatory focus, or operational improvement.

2. U.S. Airports with the Highest Delay Rates (Map):
Description: Geospatial visualization plotting delay hotspots across the U.S.
Importance: Helps identify problematic airport hubs and investigate environmental, weather, or traffic-related causes.

3. Delay Reasons by Month (Stacked % Bar Chart):
Description: Stacked bar chart showing proportion of each delay cause (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft) by month.
Importance: Reveals seasonal delay trends (e.g., weather-related delays in winter, NAS delays in summer), useful for planning and resource allocation.

4. Flight Volume vs Delay Rate (Dual Axis Combo Chart):
Description: Combines bar (ARR Flights) and line (Avg Delay Rate) chart to compare operational load with delays.
Importance: Demonstrates whether higher flight volumes correlate with increased delay rates â€” valuable insight for capacity planning and staffing.
